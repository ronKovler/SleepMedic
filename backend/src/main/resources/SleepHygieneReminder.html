<h1>Hello, {FIRST}</h1>
<p>We hope this email finds you well. As a valued user of Sleep-Medic, your well-being and sleep quality are our top priorities.</p>
<p>It's time to prepare for a restful night's sleep, and we have some helpful recommendations for you:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Put away your electronic devices. Blue light emitted from these devices can disrupt your body's natural sleep-wake cycle and make it harder to fall asleep.</li>
    <li>Create a peaceful sleep environment by dimming lights and preparing your bed.</li>
    <li>Practice constant bedtime routines, such as reading a book to tire out your mind and body.</li>
    <li>Prioritize relaxation and mindfulness activities to let go of daily stress tension, allowing your mind and body to relax.</li>
</ul>

<p>By prioritizing your sleep, you'll wake up refreshed and ready to conquer the next day.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or need assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out to our support team.</p>

<p>Wishing you a good night's rest and an energizing morning,</p>
<p>Sleep-Medic</p>
